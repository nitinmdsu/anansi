  - When you hum 'twinkle, twinkle, little star', you FEEL that that line is not the end of the song (unless it's some kind of artsy song). It feels like a build-up of some kind. When you hum the second line, 'how i wonder what you are', it sounds more settled.
  - In order to feel the effect further, try stopping at 'little', and imagining the song ending there. Now add 'star', and feel the relief.
  - Sometimes the build-up and relief is extreme. I love when the "it's too much" line comes on in Radiohead's "Last Flowers". Or Nirvana playing something softly and muted, and then loud and grating in the chorus.
